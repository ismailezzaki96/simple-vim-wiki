Waikiki is a <del>poor man</del> fisherman's wiki: it provides
a minimal set of features to:

- Navigate pages (follow links, go back)
- Create links and pages ("follow" words or non-existent links)
- Use tags (via `ctags`) to index pages

Mappings are buffer-local by default; `filetype` is not touched, and
syntax/formatting (except for checkboxes) is left to other files/plugins.

If you just want to jot down simple (eg. markdown) notes in some hierarchical
way, and realized that you used only 10% of the features of the great vimwiki,
then that's why Waikiki was created <'((>< .

Usage
------
See [the documentation](doc/waikiki.txt).

FAQ
----

*What is it?*  
In a nutshell, this plugin lets you "follow" textual links in markdown files,
the same way you can `gf` on paths in vim. It also lets you easily turn words 
into links. Plus a few other goodies.

*Why don't you use vimwiki?*  
Because it's much bigger and more feature-full than what I need. In other words,
great but overkill for me.

*Is is subtle, modern and elegant?*  
As much as an orange life jacket.
